# Not on code presented here

Note due to restrictions on the dataset used in this project, a full fledge app could not be created to demonstrate the model's application nor could the final models be uploaded here.

The code in this directory encapsulates what the back-end of the model would resemble with respect to the data ingestion and output.

The full production product would take in all for the input that is traditionally recored when placing a home on the market.

Once the information is filled in the data would be parsed, features for evaluating the model would be collected, historical look-backs queried and a price prediction presented along with the filled in listing sheet.

The product would allow for advertisements for realtors to be shown prior to the final price being shown and prior to the listing sheet being accessible in order to monetize the product.
